# Startup Service

![Overview](../../technologies.png)

## Prerequisites

Before you start work on this deliverable make sure you have read all of the proceeding instruction topics and have completed all of the dependant exercises (topics marked with a ‚òë). This includes:

- [The internet](../../webServers/internet/internet.md)
- [Web servers](../../webServers/webServers/webServers.md)
- [Web Services Introduction](../introduction/introduction.md)
- [URL](../url/url.md)
- [Ports](../ports/ports.md)
- [HTTP](../http/http.md)
- [Modules](../../javascript/modules/modules.md)
- ‚òë [Fetch](../fetch/fetch.md)
- [Node web service](../nodeWebService/nodeWebService.md)
- ‚òë [Express](../express/express.md)
- [Troubleshoot 502](../troubleshoot502/troubleshoot502.md)
- [SOP and CORS](../cors/cors.md)
- [Service design](../design/design.md)
- [Authorization services](../authorizationServices/authorizationServices.md)

Failing to do this will likely slow you down as you will not have the required knowledge to complete the deliverable.

## Getting started

Now that you have learned how to use and create services, it is time to add backend support to your startup application. The main things you should focus on in this deliverable include serving up your frontend code through Node.js, calling third party services, and providing your own service endpoints.

You must use the same startup GitHub repository that you created in the earlier instruction. Update the `notes.md` file with things that you learn as you work on your startup. As you make changes to your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, commit those changes and push them to GitHub. Make sure you have enough commits that you can demonstrate your ownership of the code and protect yourself from loss. Usually this will mean at least ten commits, but in reality you may have many more than that. Failing to fully document your work may result in the rejection of your submission.

Remember to use the browser's debugger window to debug your frontend HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You can also debug your backend service JavaScript running on Node.js using the built in VS Code Node.js debugger. You should no longer be using the VS Code Live Server extension to serve up your frontend code to the browser since Vite does that now.

## Third party APIs

You can find a list of free third party APIs on [FreePublicApis.com](https://www.freepublicapis.com/).

## Deployment

Once you have developed your application to where you want it, you need to release it to your production environment. **Replace** your previous startup deployment script with a copy of the `deployService.sh` script from the [Simon Service repository](https://github.com/webprogramming260/simon-service/blob/main/deployService.sh) and use `startup` for the service parameter (`-s`).

```sh
./deployService.sh -k <yourpemkey> -h <yourdomain> -s startup
```

For example,

```sh
./deployService.sh -k ~/keys/production.pem -h yourdomain.click -s startup
```

Doing this will make this deliverable of your startup available from `https://startup.yourdomainname`.

## üöÄ Deliverable

1. Review and deploy Simon Service

   1. Clone the Simon Service repository to your development environment.
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/webprogramming260/simon-service.git
      ```
   1. Run `npm install` in the root of the project.
   1. Open the project in VS Code and examine the application's use of Node.js, Express, and JavaScript to create service endpoints.
   1. Execute in your development environment by debugging the application using VS Code's Node.js debugger (press F5 while viewing `index.js`). Set breakpoints in VS Code and step through the backend JavaScript.
   1. Start your frontend code using Vite by running `npm run dev`.
   1. Open your browser to http://localhost:5173 and use the browser's dev tools to step through the frontend JavaScript using the Source tab.
   1. Deploy to your production environment using the deployment script so that it is available with your domain's `simon` subdomain.

1. Convert your startup application into a web service using Node.js and Express.

   1. Create a service/index.js file for your backend
   1. Add this code to service/index.js to allow your code to select a port to run on based on the command line parameters.
      ```js
      const port = process.argv.length > 2 ? process.argv[2] : 4000;
      ```
   1. Add this code to service/index.js to cause Express static middleware to serve files from the public directory once your code has been deployed to your AWS server.
      ```js
      app.use(express.static('public'));
      ```
   1. Add a vite.config.js file to your main startup directory (right above the service and src directories) with the following content (or copy it over from Simon). This will forward fetch requests that go to a path like "fetch('/api/scores')" to connect to your backend server running on port 4000.

      ```js
      import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

      export default defineConfig({
        server: {
          proxy: {
            '/api': 'http://localhost:4000',
          },
        },
      });
      ```

   1. Create new endpoints for your backend (service/index.js) that are similar to those created by Simon.
   1. Call your endpoints from your frontend code using fetch.
   1. Call third party endpoints from your frontend code using fetch. This can be as simple as displaying a quote like Simon does.
   1. Debug your application by running your backend using VS Code's Node debugger on the service/index.js file and the browser's inspect dev tools to verify it is working correctly. You will have to run "npm run dev" to get your front end running.
   1. Periodically commit and push your code to GitHub.
   1. Periodically update your startup repository's notes.md file to reflect what you have learned and want to remember.
   1. Push your final version of your project to GitHub.
   1. Copy "deployService.sh" over from your Simon Service source code. You won't be able to use the deploy scripts from previous projects.
   1. Deploy your startup application to your production environment (your server) using "deployService.sh".
   1. Make sure your application is available from your production environment.
   1. Upload the URL to your startup application to the Canvas assignment.

## Grading Rubric

- **Prerequisite**: Simon Service deployed to your production environment
- **Prerequisite**: A link to your GitHub startup repository prominently displayed on your application's home page
- **Prerequisite**: Notes in your startup Git repository README.md file documenting what you modified and added with this deliverable. The TAs will only grade things that have been clearly described as being completed. Review the [voter app](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example) as an example.
- **Prerequisite**: Enough Git commits to fully prove your ownership of your code. This usually means dozens of commits spread across multiple days of the deliverable development period. Failure to do this may result in the rejection of your submission.
- Backend web service support and interaction
  - 10% - Create an HTTP service using Node.js and Express
  - 10% - Frontend served up using Express static middleware
  - 10% - Your frontend calls third party service endpoints
  - 20% - Your backend provides service endpoints
  - 20% - Your frontend calls your service endpoints
  - 30% - Supports registration, login, logout, and restricted endpoint

## Go celebrate

You did it! This is a significant milestone. Time to grab some friends, show them what you did, and celebrate by watching a movie with popcorn üçø.
